This SageMath script implements the Bondi-Sachs metric for asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes, following the framework outlined by Mitman et al.([Computation of displacement and spin gravitational memory in numerical relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11562)). It follows the Bondi formalism, focusing on vacuum solutions near future null infinity with retarded Bondi coordinates.

Important Notes:

Asymptotic expansions Equation (12-15) are not implemented yet, but the codeâ€™s structure supports future inclusion of expansions for the Bondi mass aspect, angular momentum aspect, share, etc.


Future Extensions

This code is designed to be extended with:
1. Asymptotic expansions of metric functions, incorporating Bondi mass aspect, angular momentum aspect, shear tensor, and their evolution.
2. Computations of non linear memory effects

What is Bondi-Sachs formalism? (http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01731)

The Bondi-Sachs formalism of General Relativity is a metric-based treatment of the Einstein equations in which the coordinates are adapted to the null geodesics of the spacetime. It provided the first convincing evidence that gravitational radiation is a nonlinear effect of general relativity and that the emission of gravitational waves from an isolated system is accompanied by a mass loss from the system. The asymptotic behaviour of the Bondi-Sachs metric revealed the existence of the symmetry group at null infinity, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, which turned out to be larger than the Poincare group.
