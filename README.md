# bms-frame-sagemanifold
This SageMath script implements the Bondi-Sachs metric for asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes, following the framework outlined by Mitman et al.([Computation of displacement and spin gravitational memory in numerical relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11562)). It follows the Bondi formalism, focusing on vacuum solutions near future null infinity with retarded Bondi coordinates.

Important Notes

Asymptotic expansions Equation (12-15) are not implemented yet, but the codeâ€™s structure supports future inclusion of expansions for the Bondi mass aspect, angular momentum aspect, share, etc.


Future Extensions

This code is designed to be extended with:
1. Asymptotic expansions of metric functions, incorporating Bondi mass aspect, angular momentum aspect, shear tensor, and their evolution.
2. Computations of non linear memory effects
